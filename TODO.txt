Protocol:
* es_rod_position_server, shutdown rods
* {set, flux_now, Flux} i {set_now, flux, Flux} transform to {set, flux, Flux}

General features:
* implement es_rod_controller_server
* es_action_server should log it's actions

Erlang/OTP problem
* errors in snapshot file do not generate error report
* if two gen_tcp servers listen on the same port, they fail silently
