BUGS:
* es_connection_server:connect_to_simulator now returns {connected, [SimId, Port]} instead of {connected, Port} - see if this breaks anything
#- fix egon_client:new_sim documentation (return values are broken)

Protocol:
*- assemble by hand a list of messages which es_interface_server can send to other servers
#0 es_makeup_buffer_server {action, _, [RCS, VADD]} transform to {action, _, VADD} - beware of deadlock with es_core_server
%+ more restrictive packet definition regexp in es_lib_tcp, with error recovery

General features:
*- es_clock_server:send_tick/2 should use gen_server:cast instead of gen_server:call
*0 extract client code from egon_server
*- sanity check when egon_server starts (egon_client:client_test/0 could be a good sanity check)
#+ every server should have a function which sends all of its exported state variables to es_log_server; that function should be called right after init and every time state is changed -> therefore es_log_server will have a log of all values changes and will be able to plot graphs
#- implement es_log_server:get_time_range(SimId, StartTime, StopTime, Points) which will return list of values of Points in time range from StartTime to StopTime
#0 changing simulation speed
#- add logging to configuration file

egon_client:
$- xls generation

Separating implementation and configuration:
*- move set_up_defaults from es_config_server to egon_server

Erlang/OTP problem:
#? errors in snapshot file do not generate error report
#? if two gen_tcp servers listen on the same port, they fail silently
#? if supervisor fails to start it's children, no error is generated

Userfriendlyness:
#0 generating client-server protocol from documentation (list all handle_call methods which have some modifier in it's documentation)
#0 building a release (OTP in Action, chapter 10)

Removing dirty hacks:
%0 remove timer:sleep from egon_server:sim_loaded
%0 move io:format to error_handler:info_report
#0 integrate ramper into turbine

MAJOR FEATURES ROADMAP:
1) steam generators
2) RCS inventory, PRZR level
3) trip setpoints (OTdT, OPdT)
4) subcritical multiplication
